ðŸŽ¯ Solving Real Problems with Smart Technology

The Problem: Educational institutions needed quick access to student exam results without navigating complex systems.

My Solution: A Salesforce home page dashboard that instantly shows student pass/fail status with just a name or ID search.

Built With:

Lightning Web Components for the interface

Apex backend for data processing

Integrated seamlessly into existing Salesforce workflows

Result: Reduced result lookup time from minutes to seconds, improving staff efficiency and student service quality.

Love how technology can simplify everyday challenges! What problems are you solving with code? ðŸ’¡
